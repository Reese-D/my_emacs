# s.el [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/magnars/s.el.png)](http://travis-ci.org/magnars/s.el)

The long lost Emacs string manipulation library.

## Warning

This is so much a work in progress that you should definitely not be using it yet.

## Functions

* [s-trim](#s-trim-s) `(s)`
* [s-chop-suffix](#s-chop-suffix-suffix-s) `(suffix s)`

## Documentation and examples

### s-trim `(s)`

Remove whitespace at beginning and end of `s`.

```cl
(s-trim "trim ") ;; => "trim"
(s-trim " this") ;; => "this"
(s-trim " only  trims beg and end  ") ;; => "only  trims beg and end"
```

### s-chop-suffix `(suffix s)`

Remove `suffix` if it is at end of `s`.

```cl
(s-chop-suffix "-test.js" "penguin-test.js") ;; => "penguin"
(s-chop-suffix "
" "no newlines
") ;; => "no newlines"
(s-chop-suffix "
" "no newlines") ;; => "no newlines"
```


## Development

Run the tests with

    ./run-tests.sh

Create the docs with

    ./create-docs.sh

I highly recommend that you install these as a pre-commit hook, so that
the tests are always running and the docs are always in sync:

    cp pre-commit.sh .git/hooks/pre-commit

Oh, and don't edit `README.md` directly, it is auto-generated.
Change `readme-template.md` or `examples-to-docs.el` instead.
