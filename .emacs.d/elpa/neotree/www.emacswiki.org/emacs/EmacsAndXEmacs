Emacs, XEmacs, Scheemacs...</h2><p>The <a class="local" href="https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/EmacsWiki">EmacsWiki</a> is for info and discussion about <em>Emacs</em> and <em>XEmacs</em>. Some people use the terminology of the <a class="local" href="https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/ChurchOfEmacs">ChurchOfEmacs</a> to refer to these critters collectively &#x2013; they call both Emacs and XEmacs &#x201c;<strong><a class="local" href="https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/Emacsen">Emacsen</a></strong>&#x201d;.</p><p>Some people used to make a point of calling Emacs <em>GNU Emacs</em> to differentiate it from <em>Lucid Emacs</em> which has since been renamed XEmacs. While this is less offensive and incorrect than the term <em>FSF Emacs</em> (the scope of developers and users far transcends the FSF, the main copyright holder), <a href="https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/RichardStallman" class="local">RichardStallman</a>, Emacs&#x2019;s original author, insists that <em>Emacs</em> is, after all, the proper term for the version he is still actively maintaining. Nowadays, most people are speaking about <em>Emacs</em> and <em>XEmacs</em>, but pretty much nobody is bothered by seeing <em>GNU Emacs</em> as a way to offset it from <em>XEmacs</em>.</p><p>&#x201c;Emacs&#x201d; is used in the names of a larger class of programmable editors, with a similar look-and-feel (mostly conspicuous in the keybindings) and a history going back to the original <a href="https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/TecoEmacs" class="local">TecoEmacs</a> (mid-1970s) and offshoots such as <a class="local" href="https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/EINE">EINE</a> and <a class="local" href="https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/ZWEI">ZWEI</a>. Emacs, which was created in 1985 and was closely modelled on the earlier <a class="inter WikiPedia outside" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gosling_Emacs">Gosling Emacs</a> editor (modeled after <a href="https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/TecoEmacs" class="local">TecoEmacs</a>), is simply one of many. <a href="https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/XEmacs" class="local">XEmacs</a>, which originated in 1991 as an offshoot of Emacs called <a href="https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/LucidEmacs" class="local">LucidEmacs</a>, is another. Both of these projects have a venerable history and an active developer base.</p><dl class="quote"><dt /><dd>RMS refers to his creation as Emacs, as do most maintainers, I think. It&#x2019;s likely to cause confusion to use the term generally for Emacs-like editors. E.g., Gosling Emacs didn&#x2019;t have a full extension language and so is dubious as &#x201c;an EMACS&#x201d; (the term rms used in his memo on TECO EMACS) in contrast to Jed, for instance. &#x2013; Dave Love</dd></dl><p>Sometimes XEmacs has been incorrectly referred to as &#x201c;GNU XEmacs&#x201d;. However, XEmacs is not part of the <a class="local" href="https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/GnuProject">GnuProject</a>, and the XEmacs developers object to this term, so it should not be used. RMS&#x2019; has stated once that XEmacs is not less GNU than Emacs, but this sounds contrived at best. Leaving off the <em>GNU</em> as a distinguishing feature is probably the variant likely to annoy the fewest people. <a class="inter Groups number" href="http://groups.google.com/groups?as_ugroup=*emacs*&amp;as_q=&amp;selm=199608292029.QAA01520@ethanol.gnu.ai.mit.edu"><span><span class="bracket">[</span>1<span class="bracket">]</span></span></a></p><p>Note: The X in XEmacs does not mean &#x201c;X Windows&#x201d;. As a matter of fact, <a class="local" href="https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/LucidEmacs">LucidEmacs</a> was renamed XEmacs not when it got support for X11 but when it got support for ttys. Both Emacs and XEmacs run on TTY&#x2019;s, under X Windows, and natively under Microsoft Windows.</p><h2>Usage on Emacs Wiki</h2><p>If you want to link to the Emacs page, use <a href="https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/GnuEmacs" class="local">GnuEmacs</a>; to link to the <a href="https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/XEmacs" class="local">XEmacs</a> page, use [[XEmacs]].</p><h2>Comparison</h2><dl class="quote"><dt /><dd>&#x201c;innumerable tiny differences. too many to list.&#x201d;<dl class="quote"><dt /><dd>kensanata, on #emacs</dd></dl></dd></dl><p>From a user perspective, Emacs and XEmacs are very, very similar, except for a big number of small differences that annoy long time users of the other flavor. If you are a newbie, chances are that there is no real reason to choose one over the other. The following decision making process is suggested for helping you choose:</p><ul><li>Use the one your neighbour or co-worker uses</li><li>Both feature <a class="local" href="https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/MultiTTYSupport">MultiTTYSupport</a>.</li><li>Use Emacs if non-ASCII support is important to you (see <a href="https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/XEmacsAndNonAsciiCharacters" class="local">XEmacsAndNonAsciiCharacters</a>).</li><li>Use Emacs if you agree with <a class="local" href="https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/RichardStallman">RichardStallman</a></li><li>Try both, and use whichever feels better</li><li>Roll a die</li></ul><p>If efficiency is important, use Emacs (&#x2013; Anon) unless you happen to use PSGML, in which case it&#x2019;s the reverse! That&#x2019;s because XEmacs uses C implementations of some speed-critical data structures (e.g. syntax tables) whereas GNU Emacs has them in <a class="url http outside" href="http://www.soulcast.com/post/show/69541/Just-enough-emacs-for-lisp">lisp</a>. BTW this is the only reason I&#x2019;m keeping both editors installed.

The released PSGML is slow setting <a class="local" href="https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/Face">Face</a>s while parsing under Emacs because Emacs-specific code needs fixing; there is a patch at <a class="url http outside" href="http://www.loveshack.ukfsn.org/emacs/psgml-1.3.1-debian.diff">http://www.loveshack.ukfsn.org/emacs/psgml-1.3.1-debian.diff</a> &#x2013; Dave Love</dd><dt /><dd>Is there any support for this claim [efficiency generally better under Emacs]? &#x2013; <a href="https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/AlexSchroeder" class="local">AlexSchroeder</a><dl class="quote"><dt /><dd>Yes, that&#x2019;s why I wrote it. XEmacs maintainers have said so, for instance, but you might not believe them, and want experimental results like I once posted. You can run XEmacs&#x2019; bench.el in Emacs (with minor changes) as one example. If you do, ensure you&#x2019;re comparing like with like, e.g. by turning off line-number-mode in Emacs. Either ignore the hanoi result or run the (old) version from XEmacs in Emacs. All but a couple of the tests are faster for me in &#x201c;emacs21&#x201d; than in &#x201c;xemacs21-mule&#x201d; in Debian Sarge x86. &#x2013; Dave Love</dd></dl></dd><dt /><dd>I&#x2019;m not actually going to make any claims. However, I was a long time XEmacs user that switched to Emacs. I&#x2019;ll discuss my switching elsewhere. The point is that I think XEmacs does have some problems with updating the display. There were some threads about this on the xemacs-beta list started by JWZ. Since running Emacs, I do think it&#x2019;s a bit faster or at least more interactive. &#x2013; <a class="local" href="https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/DougAlcorn">DougAlcorn</a></dd><dt /><dd>I&#x2019;m going to claim that xemacs21-gnome is significantly faster at executing elisp.

It&#x2019;s much more rare that i need this ability - eg, to remote log into a machine from a tty and use gnuclient to attach to an emacs session that&#x2019;s already running with X displays - but i might do things a litle differently if i could.</li><li>It&#x2019;s a testimony to the myriad little things i am able to get working more nicely in Emacs that i am willing to forego that big capability.</li></ul><dl class="quote"><dl class="quote"><dt /><dd>&#x2013; <a href="https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/KenManheimer" class="local">KenManheimer</a></dd></dl></dl><p>I use <a href="https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/GnuEmacs" class="local">GnuEmacs</a> because I started using Emacs before there was even an XEmacs.

Switched back and forth between <a href="https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/GnuEmacs" class="local">GnuEmacs</a> abd Xemacs between 1988 and 1995. I finally switched to XEmacs in 1995 and have been using it ever since. I have too much idiosyncratic customization and code (customized menubuffers, toolbars, subprocesses, inserting pngs in buffers, calls to shell-comand) to warrant the trouble to switch back. If I had to start over I might choose Gnu Emacs now, but Xemacs is perfectly adequate, Almost any shortcoming I can fix with a workaround in elisp.</p><dl class="quote"><dl class="quote"><dt /><dd>--<a href="https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/JavierThayer" class="local">JavierThayer</a> </dd></dl></dl><hr /><p><a href="https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/CategoryHistory" class="local">CategoryHistory</a> <a href="https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/ElispCompatibility" class="local">ElispCompatibility</a></p></div><div class="wrapper close"></div></div><div class="footer"><hr /><span class="translation bar"><br />  <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs?action=translate;id=EmacsAndXEmacs;missing=de_es_fr_it_ja_ko_pt_ru_se_uk_zh" class="translation new">Add Translation</a></span><div class="edit bar"><a class="comment local" href="https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/Comments_on_EmacsAndXEmacs" accesskey="c">Discussione</a> <a title="Cliccare per modificare questa pagina" accesskey="e" rel="nofollow" class="edit" href="https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs?action=edit;id=EmacsAndXEmacs">Modifica questa pagina</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="history" href="https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs?action=history;id=EmacsAndXEmacs">Guarda altre revisioni</a> <a class="admin" href="https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs?action=admin;id=EmacsAndXEmacs" rel="nofollow">Amministrazione</a></div><div class="time">Modificata l'ultima volta 2014-04-28 17:21 UTC da c-50-137-204-217.hsd1.mn.comcast.net <a class="diff" href="https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs?action=browse;diff=2;id=EmacsAndXEmacs" rel="nofollow">(diff)</a></div><div style="float:right; margin-left:1ex;">
