;;; Commentary:

;; provides a simple framwork for if-statements in c# code. When this minor mode is activated a skeleton is laid out at the current cursor point and using <enter> moves to the next section that needs filling out.

;;; Code:
(make-variable-buffer-local
 (defvar current-spot 0 "positions moved in if statement")
 )

(make-variable-buffer-local
 (defvar pointList '() "list of points contained for movement"
   )
 )

(defun exit-if ()
  (interactive)
  (setq current-spot 0)
  (setq pointList '())
  (cSharpIf-mode 0)
  )

(defun pushPoint ()
  (setq pointList (append pointList (list(point-marker))))
  )

(defun move-if ()
  (interactive)
  (when (<= current-spot 1)
    (goto-char (marker-position (nth current-spot pointList)))
;;    (setq current-spot (+ 1 current-spot))	
    )
  )
      
(define-minor-mode cSharpIf-mode
  "Toggle cSharpIf mode.
Interactively with no argument, this command toggles the mode.
A positive prefix argument enables the mode, any other prefix
argument disables it.  From Lisp, argument omitted or nil enables
the mode, `toggle' toggles the state."

  ;; The initial value.
  :init-value nil
  ;; The indicator for the mode line.
  :lighter " cSharpIf"
  ;; The minor mode bindings.

            map)
  ;;if mode is being called, create if statement, otherwise put cursor after if
